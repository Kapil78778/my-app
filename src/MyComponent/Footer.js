I loved the dog there he was very friendly. Met a french guy and had a nice conversation with him about the cultural differences. It was a calm and peaceful stay at Aniket Pg.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">"has everything you need, AC, wifi, rooftop. In a really great area near Assi Ghat, the best in Varanasi in my opinion. The brothers who help are so nice, they organized everything, including a taxi to the airport. Good place to stay for a good price"</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">I love this guest house. Owner and his family are amazing and help in any way possible. It is located in a nice party of Varanasi not so far from Assi Ghat. Rooms are imple but comfortable but itâ€™s the service that makes it so great. Highly recommend</li>
